# Surfs_Up

## Overview 
This analysis shows temperature data for the months of June and Decemeber in Oahu.  A potential surf shop will possibly open in the area, and an weather analysis was needed to be conducted to determine if the business would be sustainable year round.

        Image above shows a summary of statistics dataframe for the month of December pulled from the hawii sqlite database.

- Although december has less counts than June, the average temp for both months are fairly close. The average temp for June is 74.9 degrees, and the average temp for December is 71.0 degrees.  With an average temp for both summer and winter above 70, the shop would be open year round.

- The maximum temps for both months are very close, as well.  June's recorded high temp is 85 degrees, and December with a high of 83 degrees.  This isn't a ridiculous temperature.  Surfers would enjoy riding the waves in this temperature.

- Something should said about the low temps, as well.  The lowest recorded temp for June is 64 degrees, and 56 degrees for December. These are quite low temperatures, and might cause an issue for the surfers. On the bright side, the histograms below the low temp counts are far fewer than the higher temp counts in both months.
